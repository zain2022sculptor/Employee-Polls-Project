# Employee Polls Project

In Employee Polls project, I needed to create an app which allows the user to log and vote for existing polls. The users can also create more polls which can be vote by other users and themseleves. I've learned redux and state management for this project and redux was the single source of truth for state in the App.

## Instructions for Installing and Launching the project

To get started with the app right away:

- clone the repository into your local machine `git clone ${repo_link}`
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
